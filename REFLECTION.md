## Can I explain what my code does?

I developed a survey form that enables users to input their information and answer questions. I utilized HTML for the structure, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript for input validation. Together, these components ensure the form is user-friendly and functional.

## What was my coding process?

I began by planning the form's layout. I constructed the basic structure with HTML, styled it with CSS for a visually appealing look across devices, and implemented JavaScript for input validation. I continuously tested the form throughout the process to ensure proper functionality.

## What challenges did I have?

The main challenges included ensuring the form was visually appealing on various devices and creating effective JavaScript validation rules. I addressed these issues by researching responsive design techniques and improving my JavaScript skills.

## What would I do differently now?

If I were to start over, I would invest more time in planning the validation logic and create reusable JavaScript functions. Additionally, I would conduct cross-browser testing earlier to identify compatibility issues sooner.
